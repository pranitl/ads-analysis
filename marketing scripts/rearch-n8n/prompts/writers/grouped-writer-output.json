A trusted third party can reframe 'stranger' into 'support' and 'help' into 'harmony'. It’s about creating a soft landing, not a hard sell.\n\nImagine the quiet relief when the tension finally eases. When the 'no' softens to a 'maybe,' and then a 'thank you.' That’s the power of the gentle nudge, guided by empathy and expertise.",
