      "concept_design_notes": "OVERALL MOOD: The aesthetic should be reassuring, empathetic, and professional. It must feel like advice from a wise, trusted friend, not a cold corporation. Think 'New England pragmatic' meets 'deeply compassionate.'\n\nCOLOR PALETTE: Muted, warm, and natural. Think of a cozy Boston brownstone: soft brick reds, warm creams, gentle sage greens, and deep, calming blues. Avoid harsh primary colors or generic corporate blue.\n\nTYPOGRAPHY: Use a classic, legible serif font (like Garamond or Lora) for headings to convey wisdom and authority. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Lato or Open Sans) for the body text for maximum clarity and readability on mobile.\n\nIMAGERY & ICONOGRAPHY: All photography must feel authentic and non-stocky. Like high-quality family snapshots. Focus on details—hands, environments, objects (like the list, the mug)—to tell the story subtly. Avoid showing faces contorted in pain or despair. Depict both the adult child and parent with dignity. Icons on the trust slide should be clean, simple, and hand-drawn or have a slightly organic feel to match the overall tone.",
      "concept_strategic_rationale": "This final version synthesizes the most powerful elements from the original concepts with the direct, actionable feedback from the focus group. It leads with the 'Silent Alarms' hook (Concept 1), which was most emotionally resonant, and integrates the 'I'm Fine' barrier (Concept 2) as a key point of agitation. Crucially, it adopts the emotional resolution and superior visual concepts from the 'Guilt Trap' (Concept 3), such as the 'invisible tug-of-war' and the 'subtle caregiver' visual. The narrative arc was extended to include a new 'Trust' slide (Slide 6), which directly addresses the focus group's most critical feedback regarding credibility, locality, and safety ('Who ARE you?', 'Give me the proof'). The generic CTA was replaced with a tangible, high-value offer (a conversation guide), reframing the ad from a vague emotional appeal to a practical, trustworthy first step towards a solution, precisely as the user requested.",
