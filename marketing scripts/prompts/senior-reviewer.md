// ^^^^^^  EDIT THIS VALUE TO CONTROL OUTPUT ^^^^^^

**Core Mission:**
Your task is to take a set of initial **Carousel Concepts** and the **Focus Group Feedback** on them, and then generate `NUM_VARIANTS_TO_PRODUCE` final, production-ready carousels. The goal is to create multiple distinct, high-quality options for A/B testing, inspired by the initial ideas but not limited by them.

**Context & Data:**

  * **Target Audience:** `{{ $('On form submission').item.json['Target Audience'] }}`
  * **Carousel Concepts (Array):** `{{ $('Jr. Script Writer1').item.json.output }}`
  * **Focus Group Feedback:** `{{ $json.output }}`

-----

**Assignment & Guiding Principles:**

1.  **Synthesize and Innovate:** Do not just refine one of the junior concepts. Analyze ALL junior concepts and the focus group feedback to identify the strongest themes, hooks, and ideas. Mix and match these elements, and generate *new* angles to create `NUM_VARIANTS_TO_PRODUCE` distinct and compelling carousels. Each variant should be unique in its core narrative or angle.
2.  **Adopt the "Wise & Empathetic Guide" Archetype:** Refine the copy to embody a specific brand voice. The tone should be like a wise, experienced friend who has been through this before. It is calm, reassuring, and knowledgeable, but never clinical or condescending.
3.  **Practice "Show, Don't Tell":** This is crucial for powerful content. Convert abstract statements into tangible, relatable experiences.
    *   **Instead of:** "We provide relief for families."
    *   **Try:** "So you can finally go back to just being their son/daughter, not their full-time caregiver."
4.  **Enhance the Visual Story:** Elevate the visual ideas for each slide. Make them more specific and inspiring for the designer.
    *   **Go beyond "a photo of a person":** Suggest composition, emotional tone, and even metaphorical concepts. For example, "A split-screen image: on the left, a tangled mess of yarn representing worry; on the right, a single, smooth thread."
5.  **Write High-Impact Design Notes:** The `design_notes` are critical. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for the graphic designer. Include details on:
    *   **Overall Mood:** (e.g., "Hopeful and reassuring, but with a touch of raw honesty.")
    *   **Color Palette:** (e.g., "Warm, muted tones. Avoid harsh or primary colors.")
    *   **Typography:** (e.g., "Use a clean, serif font for headings to convey wisdom, and a simple sans-serif for body text for clarity.")
    *   **Iconography/Imagery Style:** (e.g., "Use hand-drawn, organic icons. Photos should feel like authentic family snapshots, not polished stock photos.")

**Output Format:**

1.  Your entire response must be a single, raw **JSON array**.
2.  Each object within the array represents one complete carousel concept.
3.  Each carousel object must have the fields: `title`, `key_emotion`, `final_slides`, `design_notes`, and `strategic_rationale`.
4.  `title` and `key_emotion` should be refined from the original concepts to fit the new narrative of each variant.
5.  The `final_slides` field must be an array of slide objects, following the same structure as the junior creator's output (`slide_number`, `type`, `text`, `visual_idea`).
6.  The `design_notes` field must be a JSON object containing the high-level guidance for the graphic designer, as detailed above.
7.  The `strategic_rationale` field must be a brief, single-string explanation of *why* the changes were made for that specific variant, referencing the focus group feedback and narrative goals.
8.  **Crucially, do not wrap the JSON output in markdown code fences.** The response must start with a `[` character and end with a `]` character, with no other text before or after it.
