Translate the data below into a rich, production-ready prompt for the image generation model.  
Target: 4:5 aspect ratio, 1080 x 1350, Instagram-safe.

**Ad Concept Data**
{
  "concept_title": "{{ $json.concept_title }}",
  "key_emotion": "{{ $json.key_emotion }}",
  "visual_concept": "{{ $json.final_content.visual_concept }}",

  "design_notes": {{ JSON.stringify($json.design_notes) }}
}

**CRITICAL PLATFORM CONSTRAINTS:**
1. **On-Image Text ≤20% Coverage:** Text must occupy maximum 20% of frame area
2. **Safe Zone Compliance:** Account for 1080×1350 with 60px margins = 960×1230 safe working area
3. **Mobile-First Design:** Single focal point optimized for 5-inch screen viewing
4. **Font Size Minimum:** ≥42px headlines for mobile legibility
5. **Line Length:** 25-30 characters per line maximum
6. **Contrast Requirements:** Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for accessibility
7. **Text Placement:** Keep critical text within center 960×1230 area, away from edges

**Guidelines**
1. Start your single-line output with `PROMPT:` (exactly).  
2. Fuse the *visual_concept* description with the *mood*, *imagery_style*, *key_emotion*, *hook_line*, and *cta_text*.  
3. **Text Integration Strategy:** 
   * Place *hook_line* (≤40 chars) as primary headline in **Primary Blue (#0A2E5D)** using Montserrat Bold ≥42px
   * Position *cta_text* (2-6 words) as accent button/badge in **Accent Gold/Orange (#F6A623)** 
   * Ensure combined text occupies ≤20% of total frame
   * Keep all text within 960×1230 safe zone (60px from edges)
4. **Mobile Optimization:**
   * Design for single powerful focal point that reads clearly on 5-inch screens
   * Use high contrast (4.5:1 minimum) between text and background
   * Avoid complex split-screens or intricate compositions that lose impact on mobile
5. **Brand Color Integration:** Subtly weave **Primary Blue (#0A2E5D)**, **Accent Gold/Orange (#F6A623)**, and **clean neutrals (#F8F9FC)** throughout the composition
6. **Typography Specifications:** Reference Montserrat Bold for headlines, Open Sans/Lato for supporting text, maintain 25-30 character line lengths
7. Maintain authenticity: natural lighting, candid composition, no generic "stock" vibe.  
8. Include camera-style cues (e.g., soft daylight, shallow depth of field, 50 mm lens).  
9. Keep the caregiver respectful and secondary, highlight the senior's dignity & activity.  
10. Avoid medical devices or anything disallowed by ad policies.  
11. Do **NOT** add Midjourney-style `--ar` or `--quality` tags. The OpenAI Images API handles size via its `size` parameter.
12. **Text Readability Check:** Ensure hook_line and cta_text will be clearly readable when overlaid on the generated background at specified sizes and positions.
