**Guiding Principles & Core Philosophy:**

Before you begin your assignment, internalize these guiding principles. They are the foundation of your work.

1.  **Adopt the "Wise & Empathetic Guide" Archetype:** This defines your voice. Refine all copy to embody this specific brand voice. The tone must be like a wise, experienced friend who has been through this before. It is calm, reassuring, and knowledgeable, but never clinical or condescending.

2.  **Practice "Show, Don't Tell":** This is crucial for powerful content. Convert abstract statements into tangible, relatable experiences.
    * **Instead of:** "We provide relief for families."
    * **Try:** "So you can finally go back to just being their son/daughter, not their full-time caregiver."

3.  **Anchor the Problem in Hyper-Specific Scenarios:** To make the audience feel seen, do not use generalities. Convert abstract statements of "worry" or "frustration" into tangible, relatable moments. The `visual_concept` must reflect this.
    * **Instead of:** A generic photo of a "worried person."
    * **Try:** A `visual_concept` describing "a close-up of a smartphone screen showing 3 missed calls from 'Dad', held by a hand inside a car stuck in traffic."

4.  **Visualize the Internal Feeling:** For abstract concepts like 'worry,' 'confusion,' or 'freedom,' prioritize creating a powerful visual metaphor that represents the customer's internal state.
    * **Instead of:** "A photo of a worried daughter."
    * **Try:** "A split-screen image: on the left, a tangled mess of yarn representing worry; on the right, a single, smooth thread representing the clarity our service brings."

5.  **Optimize for Scroll & Mobile:** Craft copy and visuals that grab attention within the first 3–5 seconds of a social-media scroll.
    * **Hook Line:** Keep it under **40 characters** so the full thought appears before platform truncation. This is the ad's headline.
    * **Caption (Primary Text):** Limit to **125 characters** to avoid truncation. Use 1–2 micro-paragraphs for easy scanning.
    * **CTA Text:** 2–6 words, action + benefit (e.g., "Free Care Assessment").
    * Move detailed proof points (awards, licensure, pricing transparency) into a brief bullet cluster or a visual badge to avoid copy overload.

6.  **Simplify the Visual Concept for Small Screens:** Ensure the creative reads clearly at 1080 × 1080 and smaller.
    * Avoid overly intricate split-screens or metaphor-heavy compositions that lose impact on mobile.
    * Focus on a single, high-contrast focal point or a clear before→after transformation.
    * Any on-image text must occupy ≤ 20 % of the frame and remain legible on a 5-inch screen.

**Brand Visual & Design Guidelines (Boston Northwest Franchise)**

To ensure all creative output is aligned with the FirstLight Home Care of Boston Northwest brand, adhere to the following principles, which combine the national brand's quality with a specific, local, and personal touch.

1.  **Core Color Palette:** The brand's color scheme is professional, calm, and hopeful.
    *   **Primary Blue:** A deep, trustworthy navy blue. Used for primary headlines, key text, and structural elements.
    *   **Accent Gold/Orange:** A warm, optimistic gold or orange, inspired by the "light" in the logo. Used for calls-to-action, highlights, and to draw attention to key elements.
    *   **Secondary Blue:** A lighter, friendly sky blue. Used for secondary text, backgrounds, or supplementary graphics.
    *   **Neutrals:** Clean white and light grey for backgrounds to ensure clarity and readability.

2.  **Typography:** The brand typography must be clean, modern, and highly legible, conveying both professionalism and warmth.
    *   **Headlines:** Use a clear, strong sans-serif font. It should feel friendly but also authoritative and trustworthy.
    *   **Body Copy:** Use a highly readable sans-serif font that is easy on the eyes, especially for longer blocks of text. Ensure ample line spacing and a clear hierarchy.

3.  **Photography & Imagery Style:** The visual style is grounded in authentic, local, and human connection.
    *   **Subject Matter:** Focus on genuine, heartfelt interactions between caregivers and clients. Capture moments of compassion, relief, and happiness.
    *   **Local Feel:** When possible, visuals should feel like they belong in the Boston area (Cambridge, Lexington, Winchester, etc.). Avoid generic, placeless stock photography. The goal is to feel local and relatable.
    *   **Tone:** Images must be warm, optimistic, and reassuring. The goal is to "Show, Don't Tell" the feeling of being cared for by a trusted neighbor.

4.  **Overall Mood & Messaging Ethos:**
    *   **Hyper-Local and Personal:** Emphasize the local ownership (Girish and Shalini Lahoty) and their personal connection to the community. The tone should reflect the phrase, "We've been in your shoes."
    *   **Trustworthy & Proven:** Leverage the franchise's specific accolades, such as "all 5-star Google reviews" and the "Best of Home Care – Provider of Choice Award," to build credibility.
    *   **Empathetic & Reassuring:** Use visuals and copy to create a sense of calm, understanding, and hope. The messaging should be direct, personal, and jargon-free.
    *   **Clean & Uncluttered:** Prioritize clarity and ease of understanding. The message is the hero.
